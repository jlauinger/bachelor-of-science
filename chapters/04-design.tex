This chapter proposes a means of detecting MAC addresses through sample correlation. The algorithm is implemented in Matlab as a proof-of-concept.

\section{High-Level Detector Design}

The high-level design of a senders detector based on MAC addresses is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:blockdesign}. From the beginning of my work until the final version, multiple design choices have changed. These and their reasons are depicted in detail in Chapter 5. The overall concept has however remained unmodified.

First of all, it is important to decide which MAC addresses should be tried when processing a recevied collision. Since MAC addresses are 6 byte values, there are $2^{48} \approx 3 \cdot 10^{14}$ possible instances. Although some MAC addresses are invalid, since the first three bytes denote the network interface vendor, and not all values have been issued \cite{ieeeoui}, there are still by far too many to try out all of them for every collision.

Instead, I make use of the operating system's ARP stack. During normal network operation, the kernel already keeps a cache of MAC addresses that are reachable. This list is perfectly suited for detecting senders, since it is quite likely that a collision occurs between senders that are already in the network for some time.\\

Next, I modulate IEEE 802.11 data frames for every cached MAC address. These are used as reference signals for correlation with incoming collisions. Only a small part of the reference frames contains the MAC address bits and is important for sender detection. I describe this region in detail in section \ref{sec:mac-periods}.

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:mac-and-phy}, there are different possibilities for frame modulation, namely the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), the scrambler initialization, and the error-correcting convolutional encoding. Since the encoder uses a 7 bit state, only the MAC header field directly preceeding the sender MAC address is relevant here. That field is the destination MAC address. In theory, all possible combinations could be modulated for the refernce signals cache, however this would mean a total amount of  more than 130 thousand candidates for every MAC address in the ARP pool. In chapter \ref{ch:evaluation} I evaluate which fields matter to which extent.

$$ N_{MCS} \cdot N_{Scrambler} \cdot N_{Dest} = 8 \cdot 127 \cdot 128 = 130 048 $$\vspace{0cm}

The modulation process comprises the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Generate a MAC header with appropriate sender and destination MAC addresses
	\item Apply the scrambler with specific initialization value
	\item Run the convolutional encoder, which is deterministic
	\item Group bits and interleave symbols
	\item For a time-domain signal, apply inverse fourier transform and add a cyclic prefix
\end{enumerate}

For correlation in the frequency-domain, I omit step 5. The received collision signal has to be applied to the fourier transform in this case. I have done experiments with frequency-domain detection and show the results of these in section \ref{sec:freqd-correlation}.\\

When the receiver senses a transmission, I determine whether it is a collision using the IEEE 802.11 Long Training Field. Section \ref{sec:preamble-corr} gives details about this process. This also measures a possible delay between the two frames.

Upon noticing a collision, all reference samples are correlated with the signal under test. The correlations are then sorted descending by correlation magnitude. The highest correlations make up for the best guess which senders are subject to the collision.\\

It is worth noting that the output of this algorithm is always a probabilistic result. The technique will never detect senders with full confidence, but rather return a distribution of likelihood over the cache of reasonable MAC addresses.

\section{Detecting Frames and Collisions}\label{sec:preamble-corr}

A receiver antenna captures a continuous stream of samples. It is necessary to employ some mechanism to detect the start of a transmission. IEEE 802.11 receivers in regular operation use the known preamble for this by correlating the Long Training Field to the incoming data in a sliding window approach \cite{NEEDED}.

This can be extended to recognizing collisions. Since the Long Training Field is designed in such a way that it hardly correlates with itself \cite{NEEDED}, there will be twice as many correlation peaks in a collision of two frames. The distance between the two LTF pattern can even be used to calculate a possible delay between the two transmissions. An example of such correlation peaks in the case of a collision is shown in figure \ref{fig:preamble-corr}. Each frame causes two large spikes, and 1 spike with smaller magnitude. This is caused by the composition of the LTF with two repetitions of a symbol, and a cyclic prefix of half the symbol size.\\

Knowing when the frames start is important for sender detection. Since the MAC address is represented by only a small number of time-domain samples (see section \ref{sec:mac-periods}), it is vital to correlate the correct region of the signal.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/images/preamble-correlation}
	\caption{Cross Correlation of Collision Samples with Long Training Field}
	\label{fig:preamble-corr}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:preamble-corr} offers additional markers for the different signal fields as described in section \ref{sec:mac-and-phy}. Here, the symbols containing the MAC address of the first frame begin after 1120 samples. The second MAC address follows with an offset of about 40 samples.

When trying to decode these MAC addresses, the correlations with the reference pool signals obviously have to be applied to the combined region of the first and second MAC addresses. In this examples, that would be all of the colored samples.

\section{Periods containing MAC Addresses}\label{sec:mac-periods}

Depending on the Modulation and Coding Scheme, the samples affected by different MAC addresses start at different positions. While the byte offset within the MAC layer header remains the same, the amount of OFDM symbols that need to be skipped before the beginning, and the symbol count that has to be included to cover everything change depending on the bit density.

Table \ref{tbl:sample-offsets} provides a summary of the various samples offsets for different Modulation and Coding schemes. These values are calculated assuming of a sampling rate of 20 MHz. Since IEEE 802.11 a/g channels have a bandwidth of 20 MHz, this is the minimum required sampling rate \cite{ieee2012}. However, some radios like the WARP boards use a higher sampling rate of 40 MHz. In this case, all indices have to be doubled.\\

All frames begin with the preamble, specifically the Short and Long Training Fields and the Signal Field. Both the STF and LTF have a duration of 8 $\mu$s. For the STF, this is 10 repetitions of a 0.8 $\mu$s symbol, for the LTF there are two repetitions of a 3.2 $\mu$s symbol, and the 1.6 $\mu$s cyclic prefix. The Signal Field consists of one standard OFDM symbol with cyclic prefix. That is 4 $\mu$s in the case of IEEE 802.11.

In total, this means the preamble takes 20 $\mu$s. At 20 MHz sampling rate, that is $ 20 \cdot 10^{-6} \cdot 20 \cdot 10^6 = 400 $ samples. The Data field thus start at sample index 401. Within that, the Service Field as well as the Frame Control and Duration MAC header fields preceed the MAC addresses.\\

\begin{table}[ht]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|p{2.5cm}|p{4.5cm}|p{4.5cm}|}
			\hline
			\textbf{MCS} & \textbf{Address 1 (Destination)} & \textbf{Address 2 (Sender)} \\ \hline
			0 & 561 - 720 & 721 - 880 \\ \hline
			1 & 481 - 640 & 561 - 720 \\ \hline
			2 & 481 - 560 & 561 - 640 \\ \hline
			3 & 401 - 560 & 481 - 560 \\ \hline
			4 & 401 - 480 & 481 - 560 \\ \hline
			5 & 401 - 480 & 401 - 480 \\ \hline
			6 & 401 - 480 & 401 - 480 \\ \hline
			7 & 401 - 480 & 401 - 480 \\ \hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Sample Offsets of MAC Address Fields at different MCS}
	\label{tbl:sample-offsets}
\end{table}

Modulation and Coding Schemes 0 and 2 have an important advantage. Only with these schemes does the above described region contain only the specific MAC address. All other schemes contain additional data, either before the address, behind it, or in both positions.
