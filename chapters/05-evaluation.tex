In this chapter, the proposed technique for detecting sender MAC addresses during collisions is evaluated using several simulations as well as experiments on WARP software-defined radios.

Possible questions and problems include the fact, that with higher \glspl{MCS}, there could be not enough samples to correlate the rather short 6 byte MAC address. Another interesting issue is the accuracy of the algorithm with increasing amounts of noise and fading.

\section{Frequency-Domain Correlation}\label{sec:freqd-correlation}

During the implementation of the MAC address detection technique, I tried using cross-correlation in the frequency-domain. This means that instead of calculating the similarity between samples, complex symbols are correlated without mapping them into the time-domain. With this approach, the Fourier transform must be applied to the received signal.

It turns out to be at least very difficult, if not impossible, to detect senders in case of a collision with frequency-domain correlation. The reason for that is phase shift due to path delays. When a signal is received with an offset in the time-domain, the constellation is changed in the frequency-domain. This can be shown using the Fourier transform equation:

$$ F(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(t) \cdot e^{-2 \pi i f t} dt $$

Here, $ i $ is the imaginary unit, $ F(f) $ is the Fourier transform at frequency $ f $, and $ s(t) $ is the time-domain signal depending on $ t $. A time offset can now be expressed as $ t + \Delta $. Standard power laws then show that this offset introduces a constant multiplication factor on $ F(f) $, depending on $ \Delta $.

$$ F(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(t + \Delta) \cdot e^{-2 \pi i f \cdot (t + \Delta)} dt = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(t + \Delta) \cdot e^{-2 \pi i f t} \cdot e^{-2 \pi i f \Delta} dt = $$
$$ = e^{-2 \pi i f \Delta} \cdot \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(t + \Delta) \cdot e^{-2 \pi i f t} dt $$

Since both $ s(t) $ and $ F(f) $ are complex functions, this multiplication is a rotation, or phase shift, in the complex constellation plane. Furthermore, the rotation is different for different frequencies $ f $.

This leads to a received constellation similar to that shown in figure \ref{fig:freqd-corr}. To create this figure, I applied a Rayleigh channel \cite{NEEDED} to a simulated collision signal, introducing a delay of a few nanoseconds. The signals are modulated with BPSK, so ideally the only constellation points should be $ 1 $ and $ -1 $. However, due to the above described rotation, the constellation is basically a circle.

\end{figure}

This kind of path effects is not at all unusual in a IEEE 802.11 transmission. Under normal circumstances, the known preamble is used to calculate the inverted channel matrix of the path effects, as mentioned in section \ref{sec:multipath}.

When receiving a collision, there is however not only one preamble. Instead, the preambles of two different frames, which experienced different path effects, are added together. Since the preambles itself are designed to have a low autocorrelation \cite{NEEDED}, it is not easily possible to separate the two channel effects from each other. Therefore, I can not reverse the phase shift introduced on the OFDM symbols containing the MAC address.

As expected, experiments with cross-correlation in the frequency-domain without channel equalization were unsuccessful. I therefore disregarded this approach.

\section{Time-Domain Correlation}

The experiments I did using time-domain cross-correlation are devided in two groups. First, I used Matlab to simulate different field variations and channel effects. Second, I used WARP boards to try the approach in a real-world scenario. The results of these experiments are summarized in the following sections.

When correlating time-domain samples, I always pre-generated reference samples and calculated the correlation only for the subset of samples that contains the MAC address. Section \ref{sec:mac-periods} describes which period of the signal this is.\\

Reference signals are modulated until just after the Fourier transform and adding of cyclic prefix. For the simulations, I used a sampling rate of 20 MHz, which is the default output of the Matlab WLAN System Toolbox. The WARP boards use a sampling frequency of 40 MHz however, so for these experiments I used interpolation to double the rate.

All experiments used realistic real-world MAC addresses, as described in section \ref{sec:real-world-macs}.

\section{Real-World MAC Addresses}\label{sec:real-world-macs}

MAC addresses are 6 byte numbers, where the first 3 bytes are a vendor prefix, identifying the company that built the network interface. The remaining 3 bytes are a unique identifier for the specific hardware.

After initial tries with some artificial MAC addresses in the form of AB:CD:EF:12:34:56, I switched to using a sample set of real-world MAC addresses. This allowed for a closer simulation of an actual use-case for sender detection.\\

I collected 64 MAC addresses from devices that were connected to the wireless university eduroam network. The gathering was done in the afternoon on a weekday. I used airodump from the \texttt{aircrack-ng} software suite to dump all MAC addresses on the network into a file. The actual command looked like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[captionpos=b,caption={Capture Real-World MAC Addresses},label=lst:airodump]
airmon-ng start wlp0s20u1
airodump-ng --essid eduroam -a -o csv -w mac-addresses-eduroam.csv wlp0s20u1mon
\end{lstlisting}

It is important to have the wireless network interface set to promiscuitive mode. This mode instructs the driver to hand all received frames to the kernel. Otherwise, only frames that are addressed to or coming from the local station are gathered, while the rest is filtered. This would mean that only the router's and the station's own MAC address would be cached.

In a possible real-time usage scenario of the sender detection algorithm, it would also be important to use promiscuous mode in order to collect all MAC addresses. These are the addresses for which reference signals need to be modulated and cached.

\section{Modulation and Coding Schemes}

Intuitively, the overall sender detection accuracy should decrease for higher \glspl{MCS}. Firstly,
