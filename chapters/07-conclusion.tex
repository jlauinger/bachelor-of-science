Recognizing senders by correlating their MAC addresses in an IEEE 802.11 frame collision proved to be difficult. The general approach of cross-correlating samples in the time-domain could nevertheless be promising.

Here should definitely follow more text. Keywords: frequency-domain correlation, simulation vs. real-world hardware experiments.
